# Pixie Event Discovery Tool

This project is a design-based (Option A) implementation of an event discovery
and tracking tool for Pixie Photobooth.

## Features
- Fetches event data for a single city
- Stores and updates data in Excel
- Handles duplicate events
- Marks past events as expired

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Excel (openpyxl)

## Notes
BookMyShow does not provide a public API, so a scraping-based approach
was designed. Sample data may be used due to dynamic website structure.
